# UI-UX-Experiment4

## Aim:
Evaluate usability of the Netflix-style 5-screen wireframe (Splash, Login/Signup, Home, Content Detail, Subscription) to identify usability issues, prioritize fixes, and validate improvements with measurable metrics.

## Algorithm:

1.Define scope, target users, and 3 core tasks (Sign in, Find & Play a title, Subscribe).

2.Create Balsamiq-style low-fi wireframes for the 5 screens and annotate interaction points.

3.Perform a heuristic review (Nielsen’s 10 heuristics), logging issues and severity (1–4).

4.Build an interactive mid-fi prototype of the fixed high-severity screens.

5.Recruit 6–10 representative users.

6.Run moderated usability tests: for each user, run the 3 tasks; collect task success, task time, errors, SUS, and qualitative notes.

7.Aggregate metrics and map issues to heuristics; prioritize fixes (Must / Should / Could).

8.Implement design changes in prototype.

9.Re-test (same tasks, 5–8 users or A/B) a9.nd collect post-change metrics.

10.Compile report: findings, before/after metrics, screenshots, prioritized recommendations.

## Result:
